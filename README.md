# rcaSweep
This subdirectory contains code for running RCA analysis in both the time- and frequency domain.

The initial version of this code was written by Holly Gerhard, with subsequent updates by Peter Kohler and others. 

Additional code for plotting, written by Holly Gerhard, is available here: https://github.com/hgerhard/sweepAnalysis
This code is not necessary for running RCA.
